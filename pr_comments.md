Interesting concept, but this implementation needs major improvements.

### ‚ùå Major Issues:
1. **Non-functional Code:**
   - Placeholder API endpoints that don't exist
   - No actual ML model implementation
   - Fake data throughout the code
   - Will fail on execution

2. **Project Issues:**
   - Empty requirements.txt
   - Unrelated files (quote_list.csv)
   - Unrelated changes to Movie Scraper
   - No proper project structure

3. **Documentation:**
   - No README file
   - No explanation of ML approach
   - Missing setup instructions

### üìã Required Complete Rewrite:
1. Create proper project structure with README
2. Integrate real traffic APIs (Google Maps, HERE, etc.)
3. Implement actual ML model with real features
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Fill requirements.txt with real dependencies
6. Remove unrelated files and changes
7. Add proper documentation

### üöÄ Suggestions:
- Research traffic data sources
- Design meaningful ML features (time, location, weather)
- Use real historical traffic data for training
- Implement proper data preprocessing

**Status: Needs major rewrite** ‚ùå
Please implement with real APIs and functional ML model.
